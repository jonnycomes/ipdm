  <title>Sets: Conventions and Notation</title>

  <p>
    We take a set to be a primitive notion. 
    In other words, we will not attempt to give a formal definition of a set<fn>It turns out that formally defining a set is really difficult!</fn>. 
    We will simply say that a <em>set</em> is an unorderded collection of distinct <em>elements</em>. 
    Given a set <m>S</m>, we write <m>x\in S</m> to mean that <em><m>x</m> is an element of <m>S</m></em>. 
    We write <m>x\not\in S</m> to means that <em><m>x</m> is not an element of <m>S</m></em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes a set can be described by merely listing its elements. When this is the case, we will wrap curly brackets 
    around the list of elements to denote the set. For example, <m>\{1, 2, 5\}</m> denotes the set whose elements are exactly
    <m>1, 2,</m> and <m>5</m>. For another example, if <m>A=\{3, 5, 9, 12\}</m> then <m>9\in A</m> but <m>4\not\in A</m>.

  </p>

  <p>
    It is important to note that a set does not contain duplicate elements, and elements in a set are not equipped with an order.
    For example, <m>\{1, 2, 5\}=\{5, 1, 2\}=\{1, 5, 2, 1, 2\}</m>.
